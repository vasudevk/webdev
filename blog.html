      <h3>A Step Away from Them
      </h3>
      <small>Poem by FRANK O'HARA</small>
      <p>It’s my lunch hour, so I go
        for a walk among the hum-colored
        cabs. First, down the sidewalk
        where laborers feed their dirty
        glistening torsos sandwiches
        and Coca-Cola, with yellow helmets
        on. They protect them from falling
        bricks, I guess. Then onto the
        avenue where skirts are flipping
        above heels and blow up over
        grates. The sun is hot, but the
        cabs stir up the air. I look
        at bargains in wristwatches. There
        are cats playing in sawdust.</p>

      <h3>A Step Away from Them
      </h3>
      <small>Poem by FRANK O'HARA</small>
      <p>On
        to Times Square, where the sign
        blows smoke over my head, and higher
        the waterfall pours lightly. A
        Negro stands in a doorway with a
        toothpick, languorously agitating.
        A blonde chorus girl clicks: he
        smiles and rubs his chin. Everything
        suddenly honks: it is 12:40 of
        a Thursday.</p>

      <h3>A Step Away from Them
      </h3>
      <small>Poem by FRANK O'HARA</small>
      <p>Neon in daylight is a
        great pleasure, as Edwin Denby would
        write, as are light bulbs in daylight.
        I stop for a cheeseburger at JULIET’S
        CORNER. Giulietta Masina, wife of
        Federico Fellini, è bell’ attrice.
        And chocolate malted. A lady in
        foxes on such a day puts her poodle
        in a cab.</p>
